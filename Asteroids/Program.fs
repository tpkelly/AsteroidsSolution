    Reactive Programming intro with observables and f# http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/concurrency-reactive/ 

    Tasks:
        - Refactor the open GL Program.fs 
        - Reach functionality goal of : 
            Deal with basic ship movement: 
                1. Left and Right arrow should rotate the ship
                2. Forward arrow should cause acceleration
                3. Backwards arrow should cause deceleration
                4. Asteroids style position wrap around when an object leaves the screen. PLay the asteroids game if you cant remember it!
        - Test as much as possible!

    (*Below, the game state is being stored in a reference cell instead of being passed through the observable functions
        The reason is that my original approach that passed the state on directly caused a memory leak. 
        I'm not sure if it was due to my original code, or an issue with the library, but this a simple alternative that means the code is nearly the same,
        with a little local mutability.
        
        Also, reference cell is used instead of a mutable value because mutable values cannot be captured by lambdas.
